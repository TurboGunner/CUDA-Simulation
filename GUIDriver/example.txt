Message: 

Validation Error: [ VUID-vkCmdBindDescriptorSets-dynamicOffsetCount-00359 ] Object 0: handle = 0x2403584b6b0, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER; 
 MessageID = 0x82756c54 
 vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(): Attempting to bind 1 descriptorSets with 0 dynamic descriptors, but dynamicOffsetCount is 1. It should exactly match the number of dynamic descriptors. The Vulkan spec states: dynamicOffsetCount must be equal to the total number of dynamic descriptors in pDescriptorSets (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.216.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-vkCmdBindDescriptorSets-dynamicOffsetCount-00359)
