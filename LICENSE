Every non-commercial Licensee is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this work- but changing it must include reference to this license and the original copyright holder. Verbatim or modified copies without explicit consent from the copyright holder can not be sold or distributed for monetary purposes.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

This License" refers to this current license that pertains to the work attached.

"Copyright" is defined as applicable copyright laws, as well as any copyright-type laws that pertain to the distribution and the ownership of works.

"The Program" is in reference to any copyrightable work included under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be either in this context individuals or companies.

The definition to "modify" the work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission. The terms to describe such usage are defined as a “modified work” or a work that is “based on” the original. This modification should be aimed to be substantial and should be differentiable from the code base of origin.

A "covered work" is either the program in both modified and unmodified states.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law. The exception to this definition is the execution on a computer or modifying a private copy of the software.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in depending on the region/country in this context, other activities are under this definition.
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user via a computer network with no transfer of a copy of the software would not be conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

The "source code" is referring to the preferred medium in which modifications are made within this codebase. "Object code” refers to any non-source form of a work, such as the results that are obtained via distribution or creation of an executable or compiled code.

A "Standard Interface" is defined under the parameters of an interface that is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body. Or this pertains to the case of interfaces specified for a given programming language; an interface that is widely used within the given programming language.

 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities, but which are not actually part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Fundamental Allotted Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified program- within the terms that the work is not derived for commercial purposes. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may create, run, and propagate covered works that you do not
Convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you. This also extends to the
with facilities for running those works, provided complying properly with the terms of this License- which entails conveying all material for which you do not control copyright and have copyright ownership over.  This culminates into making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf; under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is expressly disallowed under this license.

  3. Protection of Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law(s).

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996. This also extends to any similar purposed laws prohibiting and/or restricting circumvention of applicable measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal authority to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is affected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it in any given medium- provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may not charge any price for this software- that discretion for commercialization belongs to the original copyright holder. Explicit consent from the original copyright holder must be obtained before any commercial resale, usage, or other use that involves the usage of the source code- or any other protected elements regarding this work, to be handled on a case-by-case basis with the licensee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a)	The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date. The modification(s) must follow the guidelines outlined; that it must be a tangible derivation of the original body of work.

b)	The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions outlined in this document. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices". However, this does include that the original copyright holder is explicitly credited as such.

c)	You must license the entire work under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply- along with any additional terms outlined in this document to the whole of the work, and all its parts- regardless of how they are packaged.

d)	A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works that are: not by their nature extensions of the covered work; not combined with it such as to form a larger program; in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium- is defined as an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

  7. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. This includes any patent licenses defined in Section 11.

Violation of this license will result in the License of this work is to be terminated conditionally or permanently at the discretion of the original copyright holder. However, if you cease all violation of this License may be reinstated after express approval from the copyright holder. An express permanent termination from the original copyright holder entirely revokes the appeal process for that given former Licensee.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not reinstated in a permanent capacity, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under any circumstances.

  9. Acceptance of Terms

This software, from the download, installation, forking, or other means of conveying, propagating, or modifying the work is inherent acceptance to this license and its terms from the Licensee to the copyrighted work.

However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate ormodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not expressly responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. This will result in immediate, permanent termination of the License and will result in a termination from any copyrighted works under this License from the original copyright holder.

  11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied licenseor other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then therefore you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
